# Signals of Death
A project with the aim to identifying from ERM data the early signals associated with dying and gross suffering leading to the moment of death.

### Primary Data Source

The primary source of data is the MIMIC-III dataset provided by the MIT. MIMIC is a shorthand for *Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care* and is associated with over 40,000 patients that had stayed in the critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. It would be an understatement to say that the data is rich and filled with potential for ground-breaking data science work.

NOTE: In order to access the dataset, you need to go through several hoops, which is understandable given the qualities the dataset has and the concerns that come with it. You can learn more about the requirements [here](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/)

### Complimentary Data Sources

As part of this iniatitive, we will map existing datasets with the MIMIC-III data.
